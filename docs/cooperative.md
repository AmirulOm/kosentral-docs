## What is a Cooperative?

A cooperative is a business organization formed by a group of people who voluntarily come together to meet their common economic, social, or cultural needs. It is based on the principles of self-help, democratic control, and equitable distribution of benefits. Unlike conventional companies that are mainly profit-driven, cooperatives emphasize the welfare of their members, where each member typically has one vote regardless of the size of their shareholding.

## Cooperatives in Malaysia

In Malaysia, cooperatives (or koperasi in Malay) play a significant role in the economy and community development. They are active in areas such as:

- Consumer cooperatives – providing affordable goods and services.
- Credit and finance cooperatives – offering savings and loan facilities to members.
- Agricultural cooperatives – supporting farmers with resources, marketing, and distribution.
- Housing cooperatives – assisting in home ownership.
- Service cooperatives – covering education, transport, and other community needs.

Malaysia has a strong cooperative movement, supported by the Malaysia Cooperative Societies Commission (Suruhanjaya Koperasi Malaysia, SKM), which supervises and promotes cooperative growth.

## Legal Context in Malaysia

The main law governing cooperatives in Malaysia is the Co-operative Societies Act 1993 (Act 502), along with its amendments. Key legal points include:

1. **Registration** – A cooperative must be registered with SKM to gain legal recognition.
2. **Membership** – Open to individuals or organizations, with voluntary participation.
3. **Democratic Control** – Each member usually has one vote, regardless of capital contribution.
4. **Capital & Shares** – Members contribute to the cooperative’s capital, but returns are distributed based on participation rather than shareholding size.
5. **Audit & Accountability** – Cooperatives must maintain transparent accounts and are subject to audits by SKM.
6. **Dispute Resolution** – Internal disputes can be referred to SKM under the Act.

## Importance in Malaysia’s Socio-Economic Development

Cooperatives in Malaysia are seen as a “third sector” (beside public and private) that bridges community welfare and economic growth. They:

- Empower communities, especially in rural areas.
- Provide affordable financial access through credit cooperatives.
- Help achieve government policy goals, such as poverty reduction and entrepreneurship support.
